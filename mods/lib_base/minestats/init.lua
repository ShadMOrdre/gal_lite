-- Anything in this table is a mineral. Anything else is, well, not.
-- 
-- Third-party mod developers need not worry about the structure of
-- this table because the table's not made public. However, if you're
-- editing this file's code, the structure is:
-- 
--      registered_minerals[node_name][drop_name] == true
-- 
-- A single mineral node might be able to drop multiple minerals (not
-- in a single instance), so this table structure allows us to account
-- for that fact.

-- order of all registered minerals.

-- It also includes a way to store player-specific, key/value pairs.

-- For starters, neither option includes a way to *remove* key/value
-- pairs that are no longer wanted. Once the data is added, you're
-- stuck with it forever. The mod-specific data storage (but *not* the
-- player-specific storage) has an option to set the entire database to
-- a given table. That means we could hack in a way to remove a single
-- key/value pair by reading the data to a table, removing the unwanted
-- key, and setting the database to the new table. I fear though that
-- this could lead to a race condition if another value is being
-- modified at the same time. More-importantly though,
