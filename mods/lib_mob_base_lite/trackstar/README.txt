Trackstar Mod v1.0 PRERELEASE
By Leslie E. Krause

Trackstar is an efficient, 3D graph-based pathfinder API for voxel games. It is derived 
from the A* algorithm and is therefore suitable for use with mobs/AI, but can be adapted 
for many other purposes, such as sound propagation and GPS-style navigation tools.

The original implementation that inspired this project can be found at:
