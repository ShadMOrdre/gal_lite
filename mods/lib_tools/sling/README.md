## Description
Sling enables item stack and single item throwing of any item. It's useful in multiplayer.

## Notes
Sling can be played with Minetest 0.4.16 or above.
It depends on [throwing](https://github.com/MT-Eurythmia/throwing).

Big thanks to [paly2](https://github.com/paly2) for not only expanding the API for the mod's needs but also aiding immensely in writing it as well.

## List of features

- Left click to throw the whole stack of items placed directly to the right of the sling.
- Sneak and left click to throw a single item from a stack of items placed directly to the right of the sling.

## Known issues
- Odd looking behavior when thrown entity lands (because it is spawned anew).
